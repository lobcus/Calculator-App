      <p>
        This app's purpose is to create the ideal calculator for you.
        We designed this app so that anyone, even with a little experience, could
        have a powerful tool in their hands.

        We are two Computer Science students at the University of NC at Chapel Hill.
        From our experience in a lot of math classes. We wanted to create a software that
        was easy for math students to use and easy to use from anywhere at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        We hope to expand this project in the future and make it more
        accessible/better for everyone.
