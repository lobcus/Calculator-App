# Calculator-App
This app is designed for those performing tedious/methodical calculations
that need to be expedited. It can also perform simple operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo.

However, the prime focus of the app was to make it useful for students in Physics or Chemistry classes with lots of formula, such as:

```
F = GMm/R^2
E = mc^2
v1 = v2 - (a*t)
```

Having a calculator that can save these functions and run them quickly and as many times as needed would help save students time and effort.

## Technologies Used
We used flask and bootstrap to design the website. We also used TypeScript, HTML5, and CSS. We are open to any new suggestions of technologies to be used.

Assuming you are on a Mac and have HomeBrew installed, run the following commands in your terminal:

```
brew install python3
pip install flask
```

There is no other software setup required.

More information on the software setup regarding windows users will be posted soon.

## What is to come:
We hope to update the interface and add features where you can define custom
functions and use them multiple times. We are planning on implementing MySQL
with this app so that we can store user data and custom defined functions.

One of our greatest goals is have popular functions displayed in the sidebar of the app.
